      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>Research in the area of recommender systems is largely focused
        on helping individual users finding items they are interested
        in. This is usually done by learning to rank the recommendable
        items based on their assumed relevance for each user. The
        implicit underlying goal of a such system is to affect users in
        different positive ways, e.g., by making their search and
        decision processes easier or by helping them discover new
        things.</p>
      <p>Recommender systems can, however, also have other more
        directly-measurable impacts, e.g., such that go beyond the
        individual user or the short term influence. A recommender
        system on a news platform, for example, can lead to a shift in
        the reading patterns of the entire user base. Similarly, on
        e-commerce platforms, it has been shown that a recommender can
        induce significant changes in the purchase behavior of
        consumers, leading, for example, to generally higher sales
        diversity across the site. On the other hand, recommender
        systems usually serve certain business goals and can have an
        impact not only on the customers, e.g., by stimulating higher
        engagement on a media streaming platform or a social network,
        but also direct and indirect affect sales, revenue or conversion
        and churn rates.</p>
      <hr> <a id="goals"></a>
      <h1>Goals of the Workshop</h1>
      <p>The research literature that considers such more direct
        measurements of impact of recommender systems on the various
        stakeholders is comparably scarce and scattered. With the
        proposed workshop, we pursue different goals.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, the workshop will serve as a platform where
          researchers can present their latest works in which they
          analyzed different forms of impact of recommenders. We
          consider both papers where impact on individual users was
          measured (e.g., more healthy eating habits that were
          stimulated by a food recommender or a more efficient choice
          process), papers that highlight effects on a community or a
          society as a whole, and papers that demonstrate effects in
          terms of business value.</li>
        <li>Second, the goal of the interactive session is to explore
          new ways how the impact of recommender systems can be measured
          within academic settings, i.e., were some impacts can only be
          analyzed based on simulations or alternative computational
          measures.</li>
        <li>Third, the workshop shall serve as an instrument to raise
          awareness in the community regarding the importance of
          impact-oriented research. This aspect in our view is
          particularly important as more and more research works
          indicate that optimizing for the most accurate prediction not
          necessarily leads to the best recommendations in terms of the
          users' quality perception or the desired effects of a
          recommender.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <hr> <a id="topics"></a>
      <h1>Topics</h1>
      <p>The topics of interest include, e.g., </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Field studies on the impact and business value of
          recommender systems</li>
        <li>Offline evaluation protocols and measures to assess the
          impact or recommenders</li>
        <li>User studies on the effects of recommenders on users, e.g.,
          on decision making</li>
        <li>Simulation-based approaches to impact assessment</li>
        <li>Price- and profit-awareness of recommender systems</li>
        <li>Network effects of recommender systems</li>
        <li>Multi-stakeholder recommender systems</li>
        <li>Beyond accuracy optimization methods for recommender systems
          (e.g., business metrics, user satisfaction)</li>
        <li>Long-term implications of deployed recommender systems</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
